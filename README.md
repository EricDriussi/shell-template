# Shell script template

> Simple shell scripting 101 template.

This template is little more than an expansion and example of the information found
in [this post](https://sharats.me/posts/shell-script-best-practices) by @sharat87
and in [the bash bible](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pure-bash-bible).

Simply run `./template.sh` and/or `./template.sh --help` and explore the
script, and it's output!

To run the tests, you'll need to run
`curl -s https://bashunit.typeddevs.com/install.sh | bash` to install
[bashunit](https://bashunit.typeddevs.com/).

Once that's done, just run `./lib/bashunit ./tests/*` and explore `test_sample.sh`!
