# Shell script template

> Simple template with some shell scripting best practices.

This template is little more than an expansion and example of the information found in [this post](https://sharats.me/posts/shell-script-best-practices) by @sharat87.

Simply run `./template.sh` and/or `./template.sh --help` and explore the script, and it's output!
